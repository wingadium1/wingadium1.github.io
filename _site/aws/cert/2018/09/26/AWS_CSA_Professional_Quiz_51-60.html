<p>52 | A 3-tier e-commerce web application is current deployed on-premises and will be migrated to AWS for greater scalability and elasticity. The web server currently shares read-only data using a network distributed file system. The app server tier uses a clustering mechanism for discovery and shared session state that depends on IP multicast. The database tier uses shared-storage clustering to provide database fall over capability, and uses several read slaves for scaling Data on all servers and the distributed file system directory is backed up weekly to off-site tapes

The logistic software has a 3-tier architecture and currently uses MySQL 5.6 for data persistence. Each region has deployed its own database. 
In the HQ region you run an hourly batch process reading data from every region to compute cross-regional reports that are sent by email to all offices this batch process must be completed as fast as possible to quickly optimize logistics.

<p>58 | You have launched an EC2 instance with four (4) 500 GB EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes attached. The EC2 Instance Is EBS-Optimized and supports 500 Mbps throughput between EC2 and EBS. The two EBS volumes are configured as a single RAID 0 device, and each Provisioned IOPS volume is provisioned with 4.000 IOPS (4 000 16KB reads or writes) for a total of 16.000 random IOPS on the instance The EC2 Instance initially delivers the expected 16 000 IOPS random read and write performance Sometime later in order to increase the total
random I/O performance of the instance, you add an additional two 500 GB EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes to the RAID Each volume Is provisioned to 4.000 lOPs like the original four for a total of 24.000 IOPS on the EC2 instance Monitoring shows that the EC2 instance CPU utilization increased from 50% to 70%. but the total random IOPS measured at the instance level does not increase at all.
What is the problem and a valid solution?</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Larger storage volumes support higher Provisioned IOPS rates: increase the provisioned volume storage of

  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Small block sizes cause performance degradation, limiting the I’O throughput, configure the instance device

<p>59 | You have recently joined a startup company building sensors to measure street noise and air quality in urban areas.
The company has been running a pilot deployment of around 100 sensors for 3 months Each sensor uploads 1KB of sensor data every minute to a backend hosted on AWS.
During the pilot, you measured a peak or 10 IOPS on the database, and you stored an average of 3GB of sensor data per month in the database
The current deployment consists of a load-balanced auto scaled Ingestion layer using EC2 instances and a PostgreSQL RDS database with 500GB standard storage.
The pilot is considered a success and your CEO has managed to get the attention or some potential investors 
The business plan requires a deployment of at least 100K sensors which needs to be supported by the backend</p>

<p>You also need to store sensor data for at least two years to be able to compare year over year Improvements.
To secure funding, you have to make sure that the platform meets these requirements and leaves room for further scaling
Which setup win meet the requirements?</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Add an SQS queue to the ingestion layer to buffer writes to the RDS instance</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Ingest data into a DynamoDB table and move old data to a Redshift cluster</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Replace the RDS instance with a 6 node Redshift cluster with 96TB of storage</li>

Provide the ability for real-time analytics of the inbound biometric data
Ensure processing of the biometric data is highly durable. Elastic and parallel
The results of the analytic processing should be persisted for data mining

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Utilize S3 to collect the inbound sensor data analyze the data from S3 with a daily scheduled Data Pipeline
