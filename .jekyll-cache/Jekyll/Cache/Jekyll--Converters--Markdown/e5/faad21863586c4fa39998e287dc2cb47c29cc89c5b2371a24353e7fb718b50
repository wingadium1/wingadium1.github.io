<p>121 | A large real-estate brokerage is exploring the option o( adding a cost-effective location based alert to their existing mobile application. The application backend infrastructure currently runs on AWS Users who opt in to this service will receive alerts on their mobile device regarding real-estate otters in proximity to their location. For the alerts to be relevant delivery time needs to be in the low minute count the existing mobile app has 5 million users across the us. Which one of the following architectural suggestions would you make to the customer?</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />The mobile application will submit its location to a web service endpoint utilizing Elastic Load Balancing and 
EC2 instances: DynamoDB will be used to store and retrieve relevant otters EC2 instances will communicate 
with mobile earners/device providers to push alerts back to mobile application.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Use AWS DirectConnect or VPN to establish connectivity with mobile carriers EC2 instances will receive the 
mobile applications ‘ location through carrier connection: ROS will be used to store and relevant relevant 
offers EC2 instances will communicate with mobile carriers to push alerts back to the mobile application</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />The mobile application will send device location using SQS. EC2 instances will retrieve the relevant others

<p>122 | A company is building a voting system for a popular TV show, viewers win watch the performances then visit the show’s website to vote for their favorite performer. It is expected that in a short period of time after the
show has finished the site will receive millions of visitors. The visitors will first login to the site using their Amazon.com credentials and then submit their vote. After the voting is completed the page will display the
vote totals. The company needs to build the site such that can handle the rapid influx of traffic while maintaining good performance but also wants to keep costs to a minimum. Which of the design patterns below should they use?</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Use CloudFront and an Elastic Load balancer in front of an auto-scaled set of web servers, the web servers

result into a multi-AZ Relational Database Service instance.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Use CloudFront and the static website hosting feature of S3 with the Javascript SDK to call the Login With

<p>123 | You are developing a new mobile application and are considering storing user preferences in AWS.2w This would provide a more uniform cross-device experience to users using multiple mobile devices to access the
application. The preference data for each user is estimated to be 50KB in size Additionally 5 million customers are expected to use the application on a regular basis. The solution needs to be cost-effective, highly available, scalable and secure, how would you design a solution to meet the above requirements?</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Setup an RDS MySQL instance in 2 availability zones to store the user preference data. Deploy a public facing application on a server in front of the database to manage security and access 
credentials</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Setup a DynamoDB table with an item for each user having the necessary attributes to hold the user 
preferences. The mobile application will query the user preferences directly from the DynamoDB table. Utilize 
STS. Web Identity Federation, and DynamoDB Fine Grained Access Control to authenticate and authorize 
access.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Setup an RDS MySQL instance with multiple read replicas in 2 availability zones to store the user preference 
data .The mobile application will query the user preferences from the read replicas. Leverage the MySQL user

<p>124 | Your team has a tomcat-based Java application you need to deploy into development, test and production environments. After some research, you opt to use Elastic Beanstalk due to its tight integration with your
developer tools and RDS due to its ease of management. Your QA team lead points out that you need to roll a sanitized set of production data into your environment on a nightly basis. Similarly, other software teams in
your org want access to that same restored data via their EC2 instances in your VPC .The optimal setup for persistence and security that meets the above requirements would be the following</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Create your RDS instance as part of your Elastic Beanstalk definition and alter its security group to allow access 
to it from hosts in your application subnets.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Create your RDS instance separately and add its IP address to your application’s DB connection strings in your 
code Alter its security group to allow access to it from hosts within your VPC’s IP address block.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Create your RDS instance separately and pass its DNS name to your app’s DB connection string as an 
environment variable. Create a security group for client machines and add it as a valid source for DB traffic to 
the security group of the RDS instance itself.</li>

<p>126 | Your customer is willing to consolidate their log streams (access logs application logs security logs etc.) in one single system. Once consolidated, the customer wants to analyze these logs in real time based on heuristics.

<p>130 | A web-startup runs its very successful social news application on Amazon EC2 with an Elastic Load Balancer, an Auto-Scaling group of Java/Tomcat application-servers, and DynamoDB as data store. The main webapplication best runs on m2 x large instances since it is highly memory- bound Each new deployment requires semi-automated creation and testing of a new AMI for the application servers which takes quite a while ana is therefore only done once per week.
Recently, a new chat feature has been implemented in nodejs and wails to be integrated in the architecture. First tests show that the new component is CPU bound Because the company has some experience with using Chef, they decided to streamline the deployment process and use AWS Ops Works as an application life cycle tool to simplify management of the application and reduce the deployment cycles.
What configuration in AWS Ops Works is necessary to integrate the new chat module in the most cost-efficient
and flexible way?</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Create one AWS Ops Works stack, create one AWS Ops Works layer, create one custom recipe</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Create one AWS Ops Works stack create two AWS Ops Works layers create one custom recipe</li>
