<p>61 | You need a persistent and durable storage to trace call activity of an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system.
Call duration is mostly in the 2-3 minutes timeframe. Each traced call can be either active or terminated. An external application needs to know each minute the list of currently active calls, which are usually a few
calls/second. Put once per month there is a periodic peak up to 1000 calls/second for a few hours The system is open 24/7 and any downtime should be avoided. Historical data is periodically archived to files. Cost saving is a priority for this project.
What database implementation would better fit this scenario, keeping costs as low as possible?</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Use RDS Multi-AZ with two tables, one for -Active calls” and one for -Terminated calls”. In this way the 
“Active calls_ table is always small and effective to access.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Use DynamoDB with a “Calls” table and a Global Secondary Index on a “IsActive’” attribute that is present 
for active calls only In this way the Global Secondary index is sparse and more effective.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Use DynamoDB with a ‘Calls” table and a Global secondary index on a ‘State” attribute that can equal to 
“active” or “terminated” in this way the Global Secondary index can be used for all Items in the table.</li>

<p>66 | Your application is using an ELB in front of an Auto Scaling group of web/application servers deployed across two AZs and a Multi-AZ RDS Instance for data persistence.
The database CPU is often above 80% usage and 90% of I/O operations on the database are reads. To improve performance you recently added a single-node Memcached ElastiCache Cluster to cache frequent DB query results. In the next weeks the overall workload is expected to grow by 30%.
Do you need to change anything in the architecture to maintain the high availability or the application with the anticipated additional load’* Why?</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Yes. you should deploy two Memcached ElastiCache Clusters in different AZs because the RDS Instance will 
not Be able to handle the load if the cache node fails.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />No. if the cache node fails the automated ElastiCache node recovery feature will prevent any availability 
impact.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Yes you should deploy the Memcached ElastiCache Cluster with two nodes in the same AZ as the RDS DB 
master instance to handle the load if one cache node fails.</li>

<p>67 | You are responsible for a legacy web application whose server environment is approaching end of life. You would like to migrate this application to AWS as quickly as possible, since the application environment currently has the following limitations:
The VM’s single 10GB VMDK is almost full</p>

<p>The virtual network interface still uses the 10Mbps driver, which leaves your 100Mbps WAN connection completely underutilized
It is currently running on a highly customized. Windows VM within a VMware environment:
You do not have me installation media

<p>68 | An International company has deployed a multi-tier web application that relies on DynamoDB in a single region.
For regulatory reasons they need disaster recovery capability In a separate region with a Recovery Time Objective of 2 hours and a Recovery Point Objective of 24 hours. They should synchronize their data on a regular basis and be able to provision the web application rapidly using CloudFormation.
The objective is to minimize changes to the existing web application, control the throughput of DynamoDB used for the synchronization of data and synchronize only the modified elements.
Which design would you choose to meet these requirements?</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Use AWS data Pipeline to schedule a DynamoDB cross region copy once a day. create a Lastupdated’

<p>Refer to the architecture diagram above of a batch processing solution using Simple Queue Service (SQS) to set up a message queue between EC2 instances which are used as batch processors Cloud Watch monitors the number of Job requests (queued messages) and an Auto Scaling group adds or deletes batch servers automatically based on parameters set in Cloud Watch alarms.
