<p>91 | You’re running an application on-premises due to its dependency on non-x86 hardware and want to use AWS for data backup. Your backup application is only able to write to POSIX-compatible block-based storage. You have 140TB of data and would like to mount it as a single folder on your file server Users must be able to access portions of this data while the backups are taking place. What backup solution would be most
appropriate for this use case?</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Use Storage Gateway and configure it to use Gateway Cached volumes.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Configure your backup software to use S3 as the target for your data backups.</li>

</ul>

<hr />

<p>92 | You require the ability to analyze a large amount of data, which is stored on Amazon S3 using Amazon Elastic Map Reduce. You are using the cc2 8x large Instance type, whose CPUs are mostly idle during processing.
Which of the below would be the most cost efficient way to reduce the runtime of the job?</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Create more smaller flies on Amazon S3.</li>

</ul>

<hr />

<p>93 | Your department creates regular analytics reports from your company’s log files All log data is collected in
Amazon S3 and processed by daily Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) jobs that generate daily PDF reports and
aggregated tables in CSV format for an Amazon Redshift data warehouse.
Your CFO requests that you optimize the cost structure for this system.
Which of the following alternatives will lower costs without compromising average performance of the system
or data integrity for the raw data?</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Use reduced redundancy storage (RRS) for PDF and csv data in Amazon S3. Add Spot instances to Amazon 
EMR jobs Use Reserved Instances for Amazon Redshift.</li>

<p>94 | You are the new IT architect in a company that operates a mobile sleep tracking application When activated at night, the mobile app is sending collected data points of 1 kilobyte every 5 minutes to your backend
The backend takes care of authenticating the user and writing the data points into an Amazon DynamoDB table.
Every morning, you scan the table to extract and aggregate last night’s data on a per user basis, and store the results in Amazon S3.
Users are notified via Amazon SMS mobile push notifications that new data is available, which is parsed and visualized by (he mobile app Currently you have around 100k users who are mostly based out of North
America. You have been tasked to optimize the architecture of the backend system to lower cost what would you
recommend? (Choose 2 answers)</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Create a new Amazon DynamoDB (able each day and drop the one for the previous day after its data is on

<p>95 | Your website is serving on-demand training videos to your workforce. Videos are uploaded monthly in high
resolution MP4 format. Your workforce is distributed globally often on the move and using company-provided
tablets that require the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) protocol to watch a video. Your company has no video
transcoding expertise and it required you may need to pay for a consultant.
How do you implement the most cost-efficient architecture without compromising high availability and quality
of video delivery’?</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Elastic Transcoder to transcode original high-resolution MP4 videos to HLS S3 to host videos with Lifecycle

<p>96 | You’ve been hired to enhance the overall security posture for a very large e-commerce site They have a well architected multi-tier application running in a VPC that uses ELBs in front of both the web and the app tier with static assets served directly from S3 They are using a combination of RDS and DynamoOB for their dynamic data and then archiving nightly into S3 for further processing with EMR They are concerned because they
found questionable log entries and suspect someone is attempting to gain unauthorized access.
Which approach provides a cost effective scalable mitigation to this kind of attack?</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Recommend mat they lease space at a DirectConnect partner location and establish a 1G DirectConnect 
connection to tneirvPC they would then establish Internet connectivity into their space, filter the traffic in 
hardware Web Application Firewall (WAF). And then pass the traffic through the DirectConnect connection 
into their application running in their VPC.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Add previously identified hostile source IPs as an explicit INBOUND DENY NACL to the web tier subnet.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Add a WAF tier by creating a new ELB and an AutoScalmg group of EC2 Instances running a host-based WAF 
They would redirect Route 53 to resolve to the new WAF tier ELB The WAF tier would thier pass the traffic to 
the current web tier The web tier Security Groups would be updated to only allow traffic from the WAF tier 
Security Group</li>
</ul>
