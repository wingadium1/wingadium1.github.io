<p>81 | You have deployed a three-tier web application in a VPC with a CIDR block of 10 0 0 0/28. You initially deploy two web servers, two application servers, two database servers and one NAT instance for a total of seven EC2 instances. The web Application and database servers are deployed across two availability zones (AZs). You also deploy an ELB in front of the two web servers, and use Route53 for DNS Web (raffle gradually increases in the first few days following the deployment, so you attempt to double the number of instances in each tier of the application to handle the new load unfortunately some of these new instances fail to launch.
Which of the following could be the root caused? (Choose 2 answers)</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />The Internet Gateway (IGW) of your VPC has scaled-up adding more instances to handle the traffic spike, 
reducing the number of available private IP addresses for new instance launches.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />AWS reserves one IP address In each subnet’s CIDR block for Route53 so you do not have enough addresses 
left to launch all of the new EC2 instances.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />AWS reserves the first and the last private IP address in each subnet’s CIDR block so you do not have enough 
addresses left to launch all of the new EC2 instances.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />The ELB has scaled-up. Adding more instances to handle the traffic reducing the number of available private

<p>82 | You’ve been brought in as solutions architect to assist an enterprise customer with their migration of an ecommerce platform to Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) The previous architect has already deployed a 3-tier VPC.
The configuration is as follows:
VPC vpc-2f8t&gt;C447
IGW ig-2d8bc445
NACL acl-2080c448
Subnets and Route Tables:
   Web server’s subnet-258Dc44d
   Application server’s suDnet-248bc44c
   Database server’s subnet-9189c6f9
Route Tables:
   rrb-218DC449
   rtb-238bc44b
Associations:
   subnet-258bc44d: rtb-2i8bc449
   Subnet-248DC44C rtb-238tX44b
   subnet-9189c6f9 rtb-238Dc 44b
You are now ready to begin deploying EC2 instances into the VPC. Web servers must have direct access to the internet. Application and database servers cannot have direct access to the internet.
Which configuration below will allow you the ability to remotely administer your application and database servers, as well as allow these servers to retrieve updates from the Internet?</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Create a bastion and NAT Instance in subnet-248bc44c and add a route from rtb-238bc44b to subnet-

<p>84 | You are tasked with moving a legacy application from a virtual machine running Inside your datacenter to an Amazon VPC Unfortunately this app requires access to a number of on-premises services and no one who
configured the app still works for your company. Even worse there’s no documentation for it. What will allow the application running inside the VPC to reach back and access its internal dependencies without being
reconfigured? (Choose 3 answers)</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />An AWS Direct Connect link between the VPC and the network housing the internal services.</li>
